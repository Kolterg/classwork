    <h1>Jason Statham</h1>
    <p>Jason Statham (/ˈsteɪθəm/; born 26 July 1967) is an English actor and film producer. Typecast as the antihero, he
        is known for his action-thriller roles and portraying tough, irredeemable, and machiavellian characters.</p>
    <p>Born in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, he began practising kung fu, kickboxing and karate recreationally in his youth
        while working at local market stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was selected by Britain's national diving
        team to compete in the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Shortly after, he was asked to model for French Connection,
        Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi's in various advertising campaigns. Statham's past professional history working in
        market stalls inspired his casting in the Guy Ritchie crime films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and
        Snatch (2000).</p>
    <p>The commercial success of these films led him to star as Frank Martin in the Transporter trilogy (2002–08). After
        starring in a variety of heist and action thriller films such as The Italian Job (2003), Crank (2006), War
        (2007), The Bank Job (2008), The Mechanic (2011), Spy (2015) and Mechanic: Resurrection (2016), he established
        himself as a Hollywood leading man. However, he has also starred in such commercially and critically
        unsuccessful films as Revolver (2005), Chaos (2005), In the Name of the King (2007) by Uwe Boll, 13 (2010),
        Blitz (2011), Killer Elite (2011), Hummingbird (2013) and Wild Card (2015). He found further commercial success
        as a part of the ensemble action series The Expendables (2010–14) and the Fast & Furious franchise. In the
        latter, he has played his character, Deckard Shaw, in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), The Fate of the
        Furious (2017) and in the spin-off Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019) which is also his debut and only
        work as a film co-producer.</p>
    <p>His acting career has been criticised for lacking depth and variety; however, he has also been praised for
        leading the 2000s and 2010s action film resurgences. According to a BBC News report, his film career from
        2002 to 2017 generated an estimated US$1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) in ticket-sales, making him one of the film
        industry's most bankable stars.</p>

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Jason Statham was born on 26 July 1967 in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen (née Yates), a dancer, and
        Barry Statham, a street seller. His father also worked odd jobs as a house painter, coal miner, and singer in
        the Canary Islands. He moved to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he initially chose not to follow his father's
        career working the local market stalls, instead practising martial arts. He grew up with football player Vinnie
        Jones, alongside whom he would later act. Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on to play for the
        local grammar school (1978–1983), which he had attended since age 11, a passion that he shared with diving.
        He practised daily in perfecting his diving techniques, and was a member of Britain's National Swimming Squad
        for twelve years. Statham competed for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10 meter, 3 meter,
        and 1 meter competitions. He said in a 2003 interview with IGN that his time with the national squad was "a
        great experience" and one that "teaches you discipline, focus, and certainly keeps you out of trouble".</p>
    <p>Statham's life in the media began when he was spotted by the agency Sports Promotions specialising in sports
        modelling while he was training at London's Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. He was also signed by Tommy
        Hilfiger, Griffin, and Levis for various modelling contracts during their 1996 spring/summer collections. In
        1997, he became a model for the clothing brand French Connection. A spokesperson for the high street clothing
        chain said: "we chose Jason because we wanted our model to look like a normal guy. His look is just right for
        now: very masculine and not too male-modelly." However, he was still forced to follow in his father's
        footsteps as a street seller to make ends meet, selling "fake perfume and jewellery on street corners" according
        to Statham. He made small appearances in a few music videos, including "Comin' On" by The Shamen in 1993,
        "Run to the Sun" by Erasure in 1994, and "Dream a Little Dream of Me" by The Beautiful South in 1995.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h3>2000–2010: Rise to prominence</h3>
    <p>While working as a model for French Connection, he was introduced to fledgling British director Guy Ritchie
        who was developing a film project and needed to fill the role of a street-wise con artist. After learning about
        Statham's past as a black market salesman, Ritchie cast him to play the role of "Bacon" in his 1998 crime comedy
        thriller Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The movie was well received by both critics and audiences, and
        helped put Statham in the public eye. For his role in the film he was paid £5,000 ($6,937). Statham's second
        collaboration with Ritchie came in the 2000 film Snatch, playing the role of "Turkish". Cast alongside popular
        actors Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, and Benicio del Toro, the movie earned more than $80 million in box-office
        revenue. For his role in Snatch, he was paid £15,000 ($20,760), 3 times the amount of his first film. Statham
        was able to break into Hollywood and appeared in two movies in 2001: the science fiction action horror film
        Ghosts of Mars and the science fiction martial arts action film The One.</p>
    <p>Statham was offered more film roles, and in 2002 he was cast as the lead role of driver Frank Martin in the
        action movie The Transporter, written by Luc Besson. He has studied Wing Chun kung fu, karate, and
        kickboxing. The film spawned two sequels, Transporter 2 (2005) and Transporter 3 (2008). He also played
        supporting roles in Mean Machine (2002), The Italian Job (2003), and Cellular (2004) in which he played the
        lead villain.</p>
    <p>In 2005, Statham was once again cast by Ritchie to star in his new project, Revolver, which was a critical and
        box office failure. He played a dramatic role in the independent film London in 2006. That same year he
        played the lead role in the action film Crank. Statham was asked to promote Crank during the 2006 San Diego
        Comic-Con Convention. In 2008, Statham starred in the British crime thriller The Bank Job and Death Race, a
        remake of Death Race 2000 (1975). American film critic Armond White hailed Statham's ascension as an action film
        star. On the occasion of Death Race, White championed Statham's "best track record of any contemporary movie
        star." Later in 2008, White praised Statham's Transporter 3 as a great example of kinetic pop art. Chris
        Hewitt of Empire Magazine, noted the film as "a dour, drab affair", but credited the film with "establishing
        Statham as a new action hero, as at ease with gruff one-liners as he was with Jackie Chan-esque
        high-kicking".</p>
    <p>In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples. Statham stated "We've
        got a movie we're trying to do, written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film, The
        Treasure of the Sierra Madre. It's not a remake or anything, but it's a little bit like that, about
        relationships and how greed contaminates the relationships these three people have. The working title is The
        Grabbers." He reprised his role as Chev Chelios in the 2009 sequel Crank: High Voltage.</p>
    <p>In 2010, Statham appeared alongside fellow action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey
        Rourke, among others, in the ensemble action film The Expendables. Statham plays Lee Christmas, a former SAS
        soldier and expert at close quarters combat using knives. The film was commercially successful, opening at
        number one at the box office in the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India, and grossed a total of
        $274 million worldwide.</p>
    <h3>2011–2015: Commercial expansion</h3>
    <p>In his first film of 2011, Statham starred in the remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film, The Mechanic, as
        Arthur Bishop. A theatrical trailer depicting Statham's character "shooting a man's head off" was banned from
        circulation by the Advertising Standards Authority for showing excessive violence. His role in The Mechanic
        was positively reviewed by the critics both in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Guardian praised
        his performance as possessing a "now-customary efficiency" in attaining "an entertaining hitman thriller".
        The New York Times noted Statham as "sleek as a bullet"; and the film "a more powerful recharge" of the
        original. UK newspaper, The Daily Telegraph hailed Statham as "England's best export to action movies in
        just about forever, a businesslike brute with gentlemanly soul." He returned to British film by starring in
        the police drama Blitz as Detective Sergeant Tom Brant. The film received mixed reviews with Cath Clake of The
        Guardian reviewing it as "not half bad" and "oddly entertaining". He was then cast in the action film Killer
        Elite. The film was based on real events, which were the subject of Sir Ranulph Fiennes' fictional novel The
        Feather Men. Statham played an assassin named Danny who comes out of retirement to save an old friend, played by
        Robert De Niro. The film grossed returned a negative budget, and was panned by the critics.</p>
    <p>In August 2011, he began filming Parker for director Taylor Hackford; the film was released in January 2013.
        Statham played Parker, the criminal antihero previously played by Mel Gibson in 1999's Payback and by Lee Marvin
        in 1967's Point Blank (though their characters were given different surnames). A. O. Scott of The New York
        Times said of the actor in the film: "[Statham], who seems to be made entirely of muscle and scar tissue, is
        comfortable with his limitations as an actor. His Parker, in any case, is more of an axiom than a fully rounded
        human being." A 2012 BBC News report estimated that his ten-year film career to date (2002 to 2012) yielded
        over one billion dollars in the box office, making him one of the industry's most bankable stars. He was
        signed on to reprise his role as Lee Christmas in The Expendables 2 in 2012.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Statham had a cameo appearance at the end of Fast & Furious 6 as the brother of the film's antagonist
        Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He reprised the character, this time as the main antagonist, in Furious 7, which was
        released in April 2015. He also starred opposite James Franco in the thriller Homefront, written by
        Sylvester Stallone, and headlined the British thriller Hummingbird. The latter film was praised by critics
        for pushing Statham's acting abilities to new heights. His "attempt to develop his 'brand' by trying more
        adventurous parts" noted by The Guardian's Mark Kermode, "[broadened] his dramatic palette". Statham
        made a cameo in the 2014 music video Summer of Calvin Harris as one of the car racers. In 2014, he returned as
        Lee Christmas in The Expendables 3. Although critically panned, the film would go on to gross $215 million
        against a $90 million budget.</p>
    <p>In 2015 he starred in the action comedy Spy alongside Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law, Rose Byrne. The film, a
        commercial success, was particularly praised for showcasing Statham's comedic side in contrast to his more
        serious roles. According to an article by Empire magazine, a Spy 2 was development in late 2015,
        with more screen time dedicated for Statham's character, Rick Ford. He was nominated for the Critic's Choice
        Award for Best Actor in a Comedy for his role in Spy.</p>
    <p>Statham was offered a three-film contract to reboot the Transporter series in late 2015, but turned it down
        because he was not given the script before the signing date and unhappy with its compensation package.
        According to an article by The Guardian, Statham expressed interest in playing James Bond in the upcoming
        Spectre film. Its author, Steve Rose noted that "there was no doubt Statham can walk the Bond walk. And talking
        his talk can hardly be an issue with a character whose accent has fluctuated between Sean Connery's Scottish
        brogue and Timothy Dalton's Welsh." After the interview there were multiple calls from critics and the
        public to instate him as James Bond in a future film.</p>
